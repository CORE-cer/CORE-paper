- [ ] Take into account that there may be multiple final states on the enumeration workaround
- [ ] Make (a, s) configurable by parameter
  - An idea would be to an argument about distribution (type: int).
    If the argument is set, you pass (a,s) to the enumeration process computed by this parameter.
  - You actually need to pass two parameters: index and |W|
- [ ] Fix tests to verify the enumeration works.
- [ ] Start working on the scala project DCORE.
